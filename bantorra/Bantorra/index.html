It maintains a tree of units that can be accessed by unit paths from the root. The framework maps each unit path to the underlying file path through a flexible resolution process that supports many existing mechanisms found in other library management systems. It also supports caching of compiled results.</p><p>In the simplest case, there is a one-to-one correspondence between units and files under a directory: the unit path <code>a.b.c</code> corresponds to the file <code>a/b/c.suffix</code> where <code>suffix</code> is specified by the application. The root directory is identified by files with a special name specified by the application. For example, the <code>dune</code> file identifies the root of an OCaml library within the dune framework. Such file is called an <em>anchor</em> in the Bantorra framework, and the collection of units marked by an anchor is a <em>library</em>.</p><p>To access the units in other libraries, an anchor can <em>mount</em> a library in the tree, just like how partitions are mounted in POSIX-compliant systems. Here is a sample anchor file:</p><pre>formats: &quot;1.0.0&quot;
deps:
  - mount_point: [lib, num]
    resolver: builtin
    res_args: number</pre><p>The above anchor file mounts the built-in library <code>number</code> at <code>lib.num</code>. With this, the unit path <code>lib.num.types</code>, for example, will be understood as the unit path <code>types</code> within the built-in library <code>number</code>. The <code>builtin</code> resolver is responsible for locating the root of the <code>number</code> library so that further resolution can continue. The resolution process is recursive because the depended library may depend on yet another library.</p><p>The application can specify an arbitrary mapping from labels such as <code>builtin</code> to resolvers, possibly including new ones created for the application. There are a few basic resolvers within <code>BantorraResolvers</code> for your convenience.</p><h2 id="modules"><a href="#modules" class="anchor"></a>Modules</h2></header><dl><dt class="spec module" id="module-Manager"><a href="#module-Manager" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">module</span> <a href="Manager/index.html">Manager</a> : <span class="keyword">sig</span> ... <span class="keyword">end</span></code></dt><dd><p>Library managers: the entry points.</p></dd></dl><dl><dt class="spec module" id="module-Resolver"><a href="#module-Resolver" class="anchor"></a><code><span class="keyword">module</span> <a href="Resolver/index.html">Resolver</a> : <span class="keyword">sig</span> ... <span class="keyword">end</span></code></dt><dd><p>Types of library resolvers.</p></dd></dl></div></body></html>
